## Important

It has come to my attention that a student named "Eric Liu" is being mentioned on the r/uwaterloo subreddit.

That person is NOT me.

They just happen to have the same common name. I've already graduated in 2020.

Please do not direct any harassment towards me, my friends or the other students named "Eric Liu" at Waterloo who are not involved. Thank you.
